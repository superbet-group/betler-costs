# Statistical Analysis - Areas for Improvement

This document outlines potential improvements for the Betler cost analysis suite. The current analysis provides a valuable starting point, but the following methodological weaknesses have been identified. Addressing these points will enhance the reliability and accuracy of the cost forecasts going forward.

### 1. Weak Model Validation

*   **Issue**: The regression models are currently trained and evaluated on the entire dataset. This can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on historical data but fails to predict future outcomes accurately because it has effectively "memorized" the past data.
*   **Recommendation**: Implement a train/test split for the data. For time-series data like this, a chronological split is most appropriate (e.g., train on the first 10 months of data and test on the final 2). This provides a more realistic measure of the model's predictive power on unseen data.

### 2. Ignoring Time-Series Characteristics

*   **Issue**: The analysis uses a standard linear regression model, which assumes that the data points are independent. However, cost and usage data are time series and often exhibit patterns like autocorrelation (where today's value is correlated with yesterday's value). Ignoring this can lead to an underestimation of uncertainty and a model that appears more accurate than it truly is.
*   **Recommendation**: Check the residuals of the regression for autocorrelation (e.g., using a Durbin-Watson test or plotting the ACF/PACF). If autocorrelation is present, consider using models designed for time-series data, such as ARIMA or SARIMA, which can account for these patterns and likely provide more accurate forecasts.

### 3. Potential Multicollinearity

*   **Issue**: The two independent variables used in the regression (`transaction_volume` and `customer_volume`) are likely to be highly correlated (i.e., more customers lead to more transactions). This is known as multicollinearity, and it can make the model's coefficients unstable and difficult to interpret, making it hard to determine the individual impact of each variable on cost.
*   **Recommendation**: Check for multicollinearity by calculating the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for the independent variables. If VIF is high (e.g., > 5), consider removing one of the correlated variables or combining them into a single metric to create a more stable and interpretable model.

### 4. Simplistic Handling of Structural Changes (Cognito Analysis)

*   **Issue**: The Cognito cost analysis handles a major cost optimization by applying a hardcoded `0.4` multiplier to all predictions after July 2025. This is a very strong assumption that the 60% cost reduction will hold constant indefinitely. This "magic number" approach is brittle and may not adapt if the underlying cost structure changes again.
*   **Recommendation**: Model this as a structural break in the time series. This could involve using an intervention variable in the regression or fitting separate models to the pre- and post-optimization periods. At a minimum, this assumption should be clearly documented as a major risk to the forecast's accuracy.

### 5. Hardcoded Outliers

*   **Issue**: Outliers are removed from the analysis by a hardcoded list of dates. This approach is not robust. If new data quality issues or billing anomalies occur, they will not be caught without manual code changes.
*   **Recommendation**: Implement a more systematic approach for outlier detection (e.g., based on standard deviations from the mean or interquartile range). Any outlier removal should be clearly logged with justifications to make the process more transparent and adaptable.

### 6. Simplistic Growth Projections

*   **Issue**: The predictive model assumes constant monthly compound growth rates for customers and transactions. Real-world growth is rarely this smooth and can be affected by seasonality, marketing campaigns, feature launches, and other external factors.
*   **Recommendation**: For more sophisticated forecasting, consider using models that can capture seasonality and trends. It would also be valuable to allow for scenario analysis with different growth assumptions (e.g., low, medium, and high growth scenarios) to better understand the range of potential future costs.
